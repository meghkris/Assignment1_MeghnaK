Spam Filter

Description: <br />
This project is a spam filter based on the Naive Bayes spam filtering method that goes through a set of ham training files and spam training files to figure out the probability of that a file is spam given that it contains a particular word, and uses those probabilities to calculate the actual probability that a file is spam  or not for a set of testing ham and spam files. The output shows the program's calculated probability that the file is spam and the actual classification of the testing file.

Improvements: <br />
I did not make any improvements to the actual model as I got a pretty good accuracy and precision value when testing with the given data in Assignment1.zip. However, one improvement that I did not know how to approach implementing could be to have a root word such as bike and count all instances of the word such as bike, biking, biked to the one index with the root word instead of each word having their own separate count. Deliberate mispellings of words in spam mails or replacing certain characters or spaces with another character to avoid detection (ex. "play now to win" vs. "playXnowXtoXwin") can also mess up spam filters over time so to counter it maybe the appearance of certain characters can be tracked and if the count of a character is especially high, the program could filter out and flag "words" that contain a lot of these characters.

How To Run: <br />
Make sure to compile all the java files and run Main.java which are all in a package together and can be found under Assignment1 - SpamFilter/src/sample/ after downloading and extracting the zip folder. The given data folder for Assignment 1 is also under the src folder. This program was created as an IntelliJ project so opening up Assignment1 - SpamFilter through IntelliJ and then building and running Main will be easier.

A window will pop up with two buttons: "Choose Directory" and "Display Results". First click "Choose Directory" and select the folder that contains the training and testing folders which each contain ham and spam folders. So, for instance, the directory of the folder you choose should look like this:

The name of the "data" directory that you choose can be anything and located anywhere but the residing structure and the names of the folders containing the ham and spam files MUST MATCH the folder names given above. <br />
Once you select the directory, click "Display Results" and then an output window with the accuracy and precision of the spam filter will pop up as well as the table with all the file names in the testing folder, their calculated spam probability, and their actual classification (whether they are ham or spam).
